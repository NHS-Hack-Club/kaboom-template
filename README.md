### Usage
#### `script.js`
This is the main file that handles level selection, sprites, and loading the game. Try not to modify this file too much except for adding your level into the game in the "levels" array.
<br>
#### `index.html` and `styles.css`
Only change this if you want to add something unrelated to the game or perhaps a menu.
#### `level.js`
Add a new level by copying one of the existing templates (`level1.js` or `level2.js`). Modify this as much as you want! Just don't forget to add it to `script.js` in the "levels" array!
